#### Setup

- `npm install` or `yarn`
- check composer.json if you want moment or other things
- `composer install`
- check bower.json if you want to add more than just lazysizes
- `bower install`
- `gulp build` or `gulp`

#### Notes

- When you install bower packages make sure to `--save` into the `bower.json` otherwise the gulpfile will fail to find and import correctly into the libraries
